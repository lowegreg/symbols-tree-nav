# symbols-tree-nav package

Symbols Tree View for Atom.io, just like taglist or tagbar for VIM.

tag-generator.coffee comes from [atom/symbols-view](http://github.com/atom/symbols-view).

**Caution** If you want to try symbols-tree-nav, you must first disable symbols-tree-view, then install symbols-tree-nav. These two packages should not ne enabled in the same time (they use the same key bindings for instance...). When you want to get back to symbols-tree-view, just disable (or uninstall) symbols-tree-nav and then enable symbols-tree-view again.

**Disclaimer** This is a fork from [symbols-tree-view](https://atom.io/packages/symbols-tree-view). I am not the original author. symbols-tree-nav only offers some more options, but be warned I am no coffee script expert, so they may be experimental! At least, I use this package and it works at home. PR are welcome! Also, new contributors are welcome.

Whenever possible, I'll create a PR on symbols-tree-view to propose a new feature that is included in symbols-tree-nav.

[symbols-tree-view-fix](https://atom.io/packages/symbols-tree-view-fix) is another fork, without any extra options, but fixes for deprecations warnings.
